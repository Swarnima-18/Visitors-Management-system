# Visitors-Management-system
This project aims to design and develop an affordable Visitor  Management System (VMS). The proposed VMS is more cost-effective than existing market solutions. Analysis has shown that it shortens the enrollment process time and significantly reduces the burden on security officers at the entrance by generating comprehensive reports instantly.
